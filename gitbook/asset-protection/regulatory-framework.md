## Structure and legal nature

Byzantine Finance SAS acts solely as a technical service provider, offering the software and interfaces enabling clients to access regulated counterparties and on-chain credit strategies. Byzantine does not hold, control, or intermediate client assets, nor does it execute transactions on behalf of users.

Byzantine Prime operates through a decentralised smart contract vault architecture. The product is a non-custodial, technology-based infrastructure, not a collective investment scheme or managed fund.

## Partner oversight and licensing

The investment infrastructure integrates several regulated entities, each operating under its own legal and regulatory framework:

* **Keyrock Asset Management**, a registered Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP), manages the smart contract vault and executes the investment strategy.
* **On-/off-ramp partners** are licensed financial institutions that conduct operate as the fiat on-/off-ramp under their own regulatory authorisation.
* **Partner custodians** provide secure infrastructure layers to safeguard digital asset transactions and access management.

Each partner operates under independent regulatory supervision and maintains its own licences, compliance, and risk management policies.

## Client asset control and safeguards

Clients retain full and continuous control over their funds through self-custodial wallets. At no point can Byzantine or any third party access, move, or otherwise control client assets without explicit authorisation through the client’s own wallet signature.

All transactions are executed via audited smart contracts, designed for transparency, immutability, and automatic enforcement of investment strategies.

## Transparency and legal documentation

The operational structure, including partner roles, risk responsibilities, and technical safeguards, is described in our [Terms & Conditions](https://www.byzantine.fi/terms-and-conditions).
