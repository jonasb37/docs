title: "What is the currency of returns?"
---

Deposits and returns are both denominated in stablecoins, in this case **USDC**.

When a user withdraws, both their original deposit and accrued interest are available in the same currency, ready to convert into fiat if needed via an integrated off-ramping mechanism.

Users can withdraw from Byzantine Prime instantly, receiving their USDC stablecoins.
