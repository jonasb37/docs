title: "How are assets segregated by user?"
---

User assets are never co-mingled with assets of non-KYC’d depositors in the Byzantine vault.

Moreover, the receipt tokens that users receive - which represent ownership over deposited assets - are fully segregated in the user wallet. This can either be a user’s self-custodial wallet or a wallet the user created as part of the on-boarding process.

At no point are funds held on a corporate balance sheet or exposed to operational discretion, not even in the case of Keyrock (the strategy manager).

User assets are segregated within on-chain vaults governed by Byzantine Prime’s smart contracts.

No funds are held on a corporate balance sheet or exposed to operational discretion.
