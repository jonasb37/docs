title: "Who can move assets?"
---

Funds can only move in three ways:

1. User deposit or withdrawal
2. Automated yield distribution
3. Strategy rebalancing within pre-approved markets (more on the mandate of Keyrock, the strategy curator, later)

All three function via pre-defined, immutable smart-contract functions.
