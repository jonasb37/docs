Byzantine Prime represents a new standard in decentralised credit, combining yield, safety, and liquidity through an overcollateralised lending framework. All operations are executed by code on-chain rather than by intermediaries.

Yield is sourced from over-collateralised lending activity conducted on audited, on-chain credit markets such as Morpho, Aave, or Maker. All logic governing deposits, redemptions, and collateral management is encoded in transparent smart contracts.

For users, this means Byzantine Prime carries the same operational transparency as a regulated credit fund, but without the counterparty exposure typical of intermediated finance.
