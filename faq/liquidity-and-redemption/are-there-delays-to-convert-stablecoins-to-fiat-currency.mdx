title: "Are there delays to convert stablecoins to fiat currency?"
---

Stablecoins represent digital claims on fiat currency.

Redemption speed therefore depends on the stablecoin issuer and the depositor's conversion channel:

- **On-chain redemption:** Depositors can withdraw stablecoins (e.g. USDC, EURC) instantly from the protocol.
- **Off-chain conversion:** Converting stablecoins into bank deposits generally takes a few hours to one business day, depending on the exchange, OTC desk, or custodian used.

Byzantine Prime itself does not handle fiat conversion; however, its design ensures stablecoin liquidity is always available, so depositors can redeem their exposure immediately and then convert off-chain through their preferred counterparties.
