title: "Where are my stablecoins held?"
---

Stablecoins are held on-chain within Byzantine Prime’s smart contracts and, when deployed, within the lending markets integrated into the protocol (e.g. Aave, Morpho).

These contracts are non-custodial, meaning no intermediary or asset manager has discretionary access to the funds.

Each depositor’s position is fully traceable, and total on-chain balances can be verified at any time.

When withdrawals occur, the contracts unwind the relevant share of lending positions and transfer stablecoins directly back to the user’s wallet.
