title: "What is my counterparty risk towards the borrower?"

Depositors have no direct credit exposure to any individual borrower.

All loans originate through decentralised markets where each borrowing position is fully over-collateralised and monitored in real time.

The borrower’s obligation is enforced entirely by smart contracts - not by trust or a legal claim - and automatically liquidated in case the margin is breached. If the borrower fails to maintain the required collateral ratio, set at a minimum of 120%, the system automatically liquidates the collateral to repay the loan before any loss can occur.
