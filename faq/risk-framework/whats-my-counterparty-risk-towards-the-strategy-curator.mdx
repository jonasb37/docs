title: "What’s my counterparty risk towards the strategy manager?"
---

Depositors have no direct credit exposure to the strategy manager.

All operations - deposits, lending, redemptions, and yield distribution - are executed programmatically by smart contracts. As a result, even in case of a bankruptcy on the side of Keyrock, the strategy they set continues operating without a hitch.

The strategy curator (Keyrock FR) has mandated control parameters but no custody of user assets and cannot unilaterally move funds. This enforces total bankruptcy-remoteness.
