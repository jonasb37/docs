At Byzantine, safety is our top priority:

- All smart contracts used in this strategy are [audited](/documentation/asset-protection/security-audits) and battle-tested extensively.
- Byzantine’s vault is built on Morpho V2’s audited architecture, inheriting its security guarantees and further strengthened by Byzantine’s custom risk tooling.
- The capital is held in a vault that has been [audited](/documentation/asset-protection/security-audits) by seven independent security firms.
- In addition, Byzantine integrates with [Hypernative](https://www.hypernative.io/), a real-time DeFi risk monitoring platform that continuously detects threats and anomalies, helping to prevent exploits before they impact user funds.
- Additionally, two live bug bounty programs are in place - see below.

Byzantine Finance never controls your assets. They are held in an account exclusively controlled by you.

## Bug bounties

Bug bounties are monetary rewards for any hackers that identify vulnerabilities and share them with the project team.
