## Structure and legal nature

Byzantine Finance SAS acts solely as a technical service provider, offering the software and interfaces enabling users to access regulated counterparties and on-chain strategies. Byzantine does not hold, control, or intermediate user assets, nor does it execute transactions on behalf of users.

Byzantine Prime operates through a decentralised smart contract vault architecture. The product is a non-custodial, technology-based infrastructure, not a collective investment scheme or managed fund.

## Partner oversight and licensing

The infrastructure integrates several regulated entities, each operating under its own legal and regulatory framework:

- **Keyrock FR**, a registered Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP), assesses the smart contract vault risk and sets the deployment strategy.
- **On-/off-ramp partners** are licensed financial institutions that  operate as the fiat on-/off-ramp under their own regulatory authorisation.
- **Partner custodians** provide secure infrastructure layers to safeguard digital asset transactions and access management.

Each partner operates under independent regulatory supervision and maintains its own licences, compliance, and risk management policies.

## User asset control and safeguards

Users retain full and continuous control over their funds through self-custodial wallets. At no point can Byzantine or any third party access, move, or otherwise control user assets without explicit authorisation through the user’s own wallet signature.

All transactions are executed via audited smart contracts, designed for transparency, immutability, and automatic enforcement of deployment strategies.
