title: "What is a smart contract vault?"
---

A smart contract is self-executing code on the blockchain that automates financial transactions.

It removes the need for intermediaries: Once programmed, it runs exactly as written.

Smart contract *vaults* are special smart contracts designed for the handling and distribution of assets.

The smart contract vaults used by Byzantine have been [extensively audited by third-party security firms](/documentation/asset-protection/security-audits) to ensure they’re safe before being used in production.
