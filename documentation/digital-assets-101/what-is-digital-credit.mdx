title: "What is Digital Credit?"
---

Byzantine Prime is built on digital credit: Lending digital euros or dollars (stablecoins) to institutional borrowers through secure, regulated markets.

These markets are over-collateralised: borrowers must deposit more collateral than they borrow, dramatically reducing counterparty risk.

## How it works

Borrowers must deposit more collateral (capital) than they borrow, keeping the loan over-collateralised and the lender protected. This dramatically reducing counterparty risk. Positions are monitored in real time, and liquidation happens automatically if needed.

**Example:** If a borrower wants to borrow 100EUR, they need to deposit 150USD. This way, the lender is protected - the collateral capital is already there.

Such transactions happen on large, audited lending platforms like Morpho and Aave - with billions in liquidity and years of reliable performance. The borrowers are mainly institutional traders and market makers who use these funds for short-term liquidity needs.

## Byzantine’s approach

Funds are deployed only across blue-chip, diversified lending markets, with one rule:

**Capital safety first, yield second.**

Digital asset lending allows depositors to earn interest on their digital assets by lending them out, similar to how banks pay depositors interest for holding cash. Instead of leaving assets idle, they are provided to borrowers, and the lender receives compensation in return.

#### How it Works

1. **Deposit assets:** Depositors place their digital assets into a lending platform.
2. **Borrowers access liquidity:** Borrowers use these assets, typically by providing collateral worth more than the loan.
3. **Earn returns:** In exchange for providing liquidity, lenders receive target daily compensation.

#### Benefits of Digital Credit

- No idle capital: Assets generate income instead of sitting unused.
- Overcollateralization: Borrowers post collateral greater than the loan size, reducing default risk.
- Stable, predictable yield: Returns come from lending activity, not speculation or incentives.
