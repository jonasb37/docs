## Deposits in USD

Every user is able to deposit fiat USD directly thanks to a digital asset _on-ramping partner._ Reconciliation is handled automatically. You will be notified when your transfer is completed.

## Deposits in USDC

Advanced users are able to deposit in [stablecoins](/documentation/digital-assets-101/whats-a-stablecoin) directly - digital assets backed 1:1 by real assets (cash or short-term government bonds).

To make such a deposit, users need to have chosen the "Self-managed account" during the onboarding process. For users looking to switch to this account type after onboarding, please get in touch with us: [info@byzantine.fi](mailto:info@byzantine.fi).
