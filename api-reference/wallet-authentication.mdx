When a user account is created in Byzantine, either they themselves or their entity are set up with a digital wallet. This wallet is linked to either the end user's device or email address, meaning no intermediaries (Byzantine or the integrator) could ever make transactions on their behalf.

## Authentication methods

Integrators have two options when creating a user account. This method will be used in the future to authenticate the user when making transactions.

### Method 1: OTP via email

This method is easier to implement, but is a little less secure, since it relies on access to the end user's email account.

### Method 2: Passkey authentication

This method is more cryptographically secure, since it directly links the end user's device to authentication, but is a bit more technically challenging to implement.

## Defining the authentication method

### Method 1: OTP via email

**Method setup:**

User does not need to do anything to set up this method.

**Making transactions:**

1. **Prepare the transaction:** The user calls the `/query/get-[action]` endpoint to receive an OTP via email.
2. **Authenticate with OTP:** The user will receive an OTP code via email and needs to enter it in the user interface.
3. **Complete the transaction:** The user calls the `/submit/[action]` endpoint to sign and execute the transaction with the OTP code.

### Method 2: Passkey authentication

**Method setup:**

By choosing this method, the user will be prompted to add their passkey to their device, either through the browser's built-in passkey management, through a third-party passkey manager, or through their mobile device's passkey management.

This passkey will be used to authenticate the user when making transactions. A same user can have multiple passkeys, and can use different passkeys for different purposes.

**Making transactions:**

1. **Prepare the transaction:** The user calls the `/query/get-[action]` endpoint to receive the passkey authentication options.
2. **Authenticate with passkey:** The user will be prompted to authenticate with their device's passkey previously added (finger print, face recognition, etc.).
3. **Complete the transaction:** The user calls the `/submit/[action]` endpoint to sign and execute the transaction with the passkey.
